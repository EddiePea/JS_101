This repo contains my code for the rock paper scissors project which I have been working on as part of the Launch School curriculum. 

The repo includes a basic version of the game and a game with 'bonus' features (e.g. the additional options spock and lizard). 

It is assumed that the user is familiar with the rules of the basic game. The rules of the 'bonus' game are explained within the game itself.
