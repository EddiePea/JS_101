- Not much coding => mostly theoretical questions
- Falsy => evaluates as false in a Boolean context
- Objects = mutable => can change their value without changing the object
- Sort => mutates the calling array!

- Example questions
    - Lesson 2 (?) or 3; practice problems where you have to give similar answers
    - Small problems => last set of exercises
    - Debugging JS; some coding; good practice => think about concepts, use them like snippets and practice explanations on them 
    - Student made snippets circulating
    - Ask other students to practice

- Curtis Sommerlatte
