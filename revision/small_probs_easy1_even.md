**INSTRUCTIONS**
- Log all even nums to console
- From 1 to 99 (inclusive)
- Each num on a separate line

**OUTLINE**
- INPUT: num limit, initial counter
- OUTPUT: numbers 2 to 98

**REQUIREMENTS**
- Log all nums to console
- Nums = even
- 2 to 98
- Separate lines for printing

**ASSUMPTIONS**
- Nums = integers

**DATA STRUCTURE**
- Numbers printed to console

**ALGORITHM**
- SET counter => start from 2
- In loop:
  - Log counter to console
  - Increment counter by 2
- Stop loop at 99

**NOTES**
- LS solution iterates over all nums (incrementing by 1, not 2)
- Use continue statement to skip over odd num iterations
