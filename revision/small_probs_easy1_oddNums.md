**INSTRUCTIONS**
- Log all odd nums to the console
- From 1 to 99 inclusive
- Each num on a separate line

**PROBLEM**
INPUT: [None specified]
OUTPUT: numbers printed to the console

**REQUIREMENTS**
- Odd numbers outputted
- Odd numbers printed to the console
- Each number has its own line

**ASSUMPTIONS**
- Numbers = integers
- Odd = if num is divided by 2, leaves remainder of 1

**DATA STRUCTURE**
- Numbers printed to console

**ALGO**
- SET counter to 0
- WHILE counter < 100, run loop
- If counter % 2 leaves a remainder of 1, print counter
- Increment counter

**NOTES**
- A for loop is more elegant than a while loop: incrementing counter etc. on one line
- In the for loop you can increment num by 2 each time -> so no need to check if odd
